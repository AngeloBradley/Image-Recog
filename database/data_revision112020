Proposed Changes:
-- since detectron is limited to the 200 or so captions in the COCO_Categories list, it 
isn't necessary to build the dictionary dynamically as images are added to the database.
Instead, the database server can create the dictionary upon it's first run and attempt
to load the dictinoary.json file on each subsequent run. 
-- for similar reasons as stated above, the caption pool directory can be pre-populated
with caption.txt files.
-- the process for adding images to the database will become much simpler as a result. 
An image's captions will still need to be passed through the caption reducer method, 
but afterwards, the image will just need to be added to appropriate caption.txt file.
